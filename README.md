The project aims to analyse all network metrics, such as coefficient clustering and betweenness, to perform community detection and, finally, to find the best way to represent the network. The network is about Wikipedia articles, particularly those related to squirrels, and how they are connected to each other. The datasets are available here: [Wikipedia Article Network]( https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikipedia-article-networks.html).

The tools used were Python and Gephi, the latter only for the visualisation part. The network analysis can be found in the file [Network_analysis.ipynb](Network_analysis.ipynb), and the visualisations obtained with Gephi in the folder [Gephi](Gephi).

To present the project, we created a virtual room on Spatial, which can be accessed here: [virtual squirrel forest](https://www.spatial.io/s/Data-Vis-6273de24fe93dc0001dda8b4?share=6534865150247293390).
